# parser
Parse words into prefixes, roots, and suffixes (morphemes)

This program aims to help on your linguistics homework by automatically parsing words into their morphemes (from a list of over 1000!). It's not perfect, so for some trickier words it will give you the most likely results and a list of possible morphemes if the most likely are wrong.
